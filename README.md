## About The Project

### ðŸ“– Overview
Voice Call Service is a comprehensive ticketing solution extension tailored for any Empress, Empress, or Custom App. It enables effortless tracking of inbound and outbound calls, designed specifically for businesses seeking to streamline customer interactions and optimize call management.

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- Ticket creation on incoming calls
- Agent creation with various statuses (On Call, On Break)
- Click-to-call feature from tickets
- Detailed log generation for each call

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started, you'll need a Empress, Empress or Custom App where the Voice Call Service can be configured.

### Installation
Use the following steps to get the Voice Call Service running in your environment:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/empress-eco/voice_call_service.git
